      "Hello, welcome and thanks for visiting my site. This is the beginning of a new chapter in my life and I’m excited to see where it'll take me. I've not been in a great place the last couple of years, unfulfilling work, putting other people first and generally feeling that I’m missing something. So it's time to change things.",
      "For 7 years I've worked in operations, from Support to SysAdmin with a sprinkling of DevOps. I’ve enjoyed it thoroughly and learned a lot from some very good people. There is one problem though, most of the time my job is just following instructions and I rarely get a chance to be creative. Luckily, there's one part where I can be and that's scripting! Bash, Python and PowerShell became my way to be creative at work and I always found working with them fun.",
      "I’ve spent quite a lot of my free time over the last few years learning PowerShell and used it whenever possible. Automating tasks like VM creation and configuration, creating tools to manage updates or view event logs and generally writing functions and scripts at any opportunity (I even wrote a PS module to control Kodi on my TV). This, combined with the fact I’ve always worked closely with developers, got me thinking… Am I in the wrong job?",
      "The thought kept coming back but I wasn’t sure how I could make a change. About a year ago I first heard of <a href='https://codeclan.com' target='_blank'>CodeClan</a>. I checked out the site, read about their 16 week course and thought perfect! Then I saw the cost, which would more than double when paying bills for 16 weeks without working, and knew I’d have to be very sure before committing. Time passed and I kept hearing and reading good things about the course and graduates (it turned out my company had hired quite a few). Then a couple months ago I went to one of the weekend intro sessions and it was fantastic! The instructors we’re all keen and excited about what they did and being around other people who wanted to learn was such a great environment to be in. The course was exactly what I was looking for, a way to get where I wanted to be.",
      "Still on a high from the weekend session I sent in my application. A few days later I got an email asking me to come in for an interview. I booked a slot for the next week and waited (mostly patiently) trying not to think about what I’d do if I didn’t get a place. I was pretty nervous during the interview, but Steph was brilliant and we had a good chat making sure the course was the right fit for me. There was a basic code test which was very similar to scripting languages I’d used before and I started to feel confident it was all coming together. I had some questions around payment options and employment prospects after the course and then that was that. The next day I got offered a place in cohort 24!!!",
      "Now that I’ve accepted the place, having to wait two months for the start date is proving pretty tough. Nerves and excitement are keeping me going but I’m also trying to make good use of the time. I committed to #100DaysOfCode and started working through the <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp</a> challenges. They’ve been good fun (and challenging) but I’m beginning to feel I need some other material to broaden my basic understanding, there’s lots of free courses for me to check out. Creating and tinkering with this site has also been a great learning experience and hopefully I’ll fill it with some amazing things over the next 6 months."
