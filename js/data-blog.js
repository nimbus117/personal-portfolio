      "I've spent most of my first 30 days of #100DaysOfCode working through <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp</a>. It's been fun and I've learned a lot but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the pace and feel I need a more solid understanding of the basics before moving on. I had a look around for other courses and guides and decided on the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com' target='_blank'>The Odin Project</a> (TOP). The paragraph above is from one of the intro pages and it really appealed to me.",
      "TOP is open source and completely free! It's a mix of their own content and links to many other free resources and courses. There's also a lot of cross over with the CodeClan pre-course work which I'm hoping will help prepare me. I've only done the first few sections of the Web Development 101 course but there's two things I've really liked about it so far. First, there's such a mix of different material from different sources to read, videos to watch, online courses to do, guides to follow and most importantly it seems to be in a logical order that builds on itself. Secondly, you do a lot of the work on your actual computer. I liked the freeCodeCamp online interface, CodePen is very cool and the Codecademy courses are great but actually setting up your own computer with all the tools needed and doing it yourself is a lot more satisfying than doing it in the browser.",
			"About a week ago I decided to move away from coding on Windows and installed Ubuntu. I've nothing against windows, in fact I'm a big fan and have predominantly worked with it over my IT career. But, even at this early stage, it was pretty evident that I was better off learning on a *nix platform. I think it was the TOP installing Ruby guide that highlighted just how difficult getting some things running on Windows could be. I'll also be getting a Mac for the CodeClan course so thought it'd be good practice for then.",
			"I've used *nix systems a bit in the past. My old job gave us all MacBooks and we looked after a mix of Windows and Linux servers in AWS. That was a good few years ago and except for the odd bit here and there I've not heavily used Linux for a while. So I installed the latest Ubuntu desktop version on my laptop (dual boot with Windows 10) and spun up an Ubuntu server virtual machine in my home lab (the Sysadmin in me couldn't resist). It's been a fun week of learning and a lot has come back to me from years ago.",

			"As a way to force myself to do everything using the command line I decided to do all my coding on the Ubuntu server VM. From my laptop I can SSH onto the server, use screen to manage multiple windows and vim as a text editor (vimtutor is a great intro). With the help of this little python command '<code>sudo python3 -m http.server 80</code>' I can run a web server in the current directory and view the page back on my laptop."

      "Hello, welcome and thanks for visiting my site. This is the beginning of a new chapter in my life and I’m excited to see where it'll take me. I've not been in a great place the last couple of years, unfulfilling work, putting other people first and generally feeling that I’m missing something. So it's time to change things.",
      "For 7 years I've worked in operations, from Support to Sysadmin with a sprinkling of DevOps. I’ve enjoyed it thoroughly and learned a lot from some very good people. There is one problem though, most of the time my job is just following instructions and I rarely get a chance to be creative. Luckily, there's one part where I can be and that's scripting! Bash, Python and PowerShell became my way to be creative at work and I always found working with them fun.",
      "I’ve spent quite a lot of my free time over the last few years learning PowerShell and used it whenever possible. Automating tasks like VM creation and configuration, creating tools to manage updates or view event logs and generally writing functions and scripts at any opportunity (I even wrote a PS module to control Kodi on my TV). This, combined with the fact I’ve always worked closely with developers, got me thinking… Am I in the wrong job?",
      "The thought kept coming back but I wasn’t sure how I could make a change. About a year ago I first heard of <a href='https://codeclan.com' target='_blank'>CodeClan</a>. I checked out the site, read about their 16 week course and thought perfect! Then I saw the cost, which would more than double when paying bills for 16 weeks without working, and knew I’d have to be very sure before committing. Time passed and I kept hearing and reading good things about the course and graduates (it turned out my company had hired quite a few). Then a couple months ago I went to one of the weekend intro sessions and it was fantastic! The instructors we’re all keen and excited about what they did and being around other people who wanted to learn was such a great environment to be in. The course was exactly what I was looking for, a way to get where I wanted to be.",
      "Still on a high from the weekend session I sent in my application. A few days later I got an email asking me to come in for an interview. I booked a slot for the next week and waited (mostly patiently) trying not to think about what I’d do if I didn’t get a place. I was pretty nervous during the interview, but Steph was brilliant and we had a good chat making sure the course was the right fit for me. There was a basic code test which was very similar to scripting languages I’d used before and I started to feel confident it was all coming together. I had some questions around payment options and employment prospects after the course and then that was that. The next day I got offered a place in cohort 24!!!",
      "Now that I’ve accepted the place, having to wait two months for the start date is proving pretty tough. Nerves and excitement are keeping me going but I’m also trying to make good use of the time. I committed to #100DaysOfCode and started working through the <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp</a> challenges. They’ve been good fun (and challenging) but I’m beginning to feel I need some other material to broaden my basic understanding, there’s lots of free courses for me to check out. Creating and tinkering with this site has also been a great learning experience and hopefully I’ll fill it with some amazing things over the next 6 months."
